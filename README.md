## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies (both frontend & CMS)

cd portfolio/portfolioAstro
npm install

cd ../portfolioSanity
npm install

### 2. Start both Astro and Sanity development servers

You can run both servers at once using the provided shell script:

./bin/run.sh

This runs:

- `npm run dev` in `portfolioAstro` (usually at http://localhost:4321)
- `npm run dev` in `portfolioSanity` (usually at http://localhost:3333)

## 🧠 Technologies Used
 
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) (`6.1.3`) – Static site generator for modern web (Target: Netlify static).
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (`7.3.1`) – Build tool used by Astro for lightning-fast bundling.
- [React](https://react.dev/) (`19.2.4`) – UI framework for client interactivity.
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) (`5.19.0` Studio, `7.17.0` Client) – Headless CMS backend with live editor.

## 🧹 Linting & Formatting
 
The project uses **Biome** for formatting and linting (JS/TS, React, Astro, JSON) and **Stylelint** for CSS/SCSS.
 
### Biome
Run these commands within `portfolioAstro` or `portfolioSanity`:
 
- `npm run format` – Format files with Biome.
- `npm run lint` – Run Biome linter.
- `npm run check` – Run both and apply safe fixes.
 
### Stylelint
Run from `portfolioAstro`:
 
- `npm run lint:css` – Run Stylelint on CSS, SCSS, and Astro files.
- `npm run lint:css:fix` – Run Stylelint and automatically fix issues.

## 📦 Build (Astro only)

To generate a production build locally:

cd portfolioAstro
npm run build

The output will be generated in `portfolioAstro/dist` and configured for deployment on **Netlify**.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Git is initialized at the root `portfolio/` directory, tracking both `portfolioAstro` and `portfolioSanity`.
- `.gitignore` entries are configured to exclude Node modules, build artifacts, and sensitive files from both sub-projects.
- You can push to GitHub from the `portfolio` directory as a mono-repo.
- This structure allows independent development and clean separation of frontend and CMS.
